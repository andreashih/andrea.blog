## Special Thanks

### Instructor
Special thanks go to my instructor, Prof. Shu-Kai Hsieh. [**Prof. Hsieh's course**](https://rlads2019.github.io/) rebuilt my self-confidence after a series of setbacks while learning programming. Besides, Prof. Hsieh inspired me to probe into the essence of language, which reassured me that studying Linguistics can be seen as a quest for meaning in life. 

### Consultant
I would like to thank my fellow grad student [**Yongfu Liao**](https://yongfu.name/), the TA of [**Introduction to Data Science with R**](https://rlads2019.github.io/lab/), for providing us with practical lab session including the introduction to Markdown and GitHub Pages. Also, his insightful advice was remarkably helpful while I was working on the website with Jekyll.
